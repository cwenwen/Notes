# API and SDK

## What's the difference between an API and a SDK?

#### API == Application Programming Interface  
#### SDK == Software Development Kit

An **API** is simply an interface that allows software to interact with other software. It's like the specification of the telephone system or the electrical wiring in your house. Anything can use it as long as it knows how to interface.  

An **SDK** or ***devkit*** is implementation tooling. It provides a set of tools, libraries, relevant documentation, code samples, processes, and or guides that allow developers to create software applications on a specific platform. 

- SDKs usually contain APIs; no APIs contain SDKs.
- SDKs allow for the creation of applications, as a foundation allows for the creation of a house;
- APIs allow for the functioning of applications within the SDKs defined parameters, like the phone lines of a house.

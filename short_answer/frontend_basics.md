## What is the box model?

The CSS box model is the foundation of layout on the web â€” each HTML element can be considered as a box, with the box's content, padding, border, and margin built up around one another like the layers of an onion.

## What is the difference between display: inline, block and inline-block?

```css
{ display: inline; }
```
The element behaves like simple text - like `<span>`.  
Any `height` and `width` properties will have no effect.

```css
{ display: block; }
```
The element starts on a new line, acts like a box and takes up the whole width.

```css
{ display: inline-block; }
```
The element behaves like an inline-level block container.  
It is like simple text, but you can apply `height` and `width` values.  


### Some relatively new display values:

```css
{ display: flex; }
```
Displays an element as a block-level flex container.  
Its child elements will be turned into flexbox items.

```css
{ display: grid; }
```
Displays an element as a block-level grid container.  
ts child elements will be turned into grid items.  


## What is the difference between position: static, relative, absolute and fixed?

```css
{ position: static; }
```
Default value.  
The elements render in orde, remain in the document's **natural flow**.  
It is **not** affected by the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` and `z-index` properties which all the other positions are.

```css
{ position: relative; }
```
The element will remain in the natural flow of the page, but it **can** be adjust by the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` and `z-index` properties.

```css
{ position: absolute; }
```
The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element.

```css
{ position: fixed; }
```
It will position itself according to the viewport. It always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
